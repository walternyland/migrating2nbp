<h1>
Import and Export</h1>
All portfolios may be saved as a single text file (exported), and then
subsequently restored later (imported).
<p>This may be used as a backup, or may be done to transfer all portfolios
to a second machine. (This second machine would have StocksMonitor installed,
and would perform a corresponding import.)
<p>The Import-Export services are available under the <tt>File</tt> menu.
If there are any unsaved edits ( as shown by a "*" at the end of a portfolio
name), then <tt>File->Save</tt> should be performed before any <tt>File->Export</tt>.
<p><b>Implementation Note</b>
<p>The data storage requirements of StocksMonitor are not large. Most users
would require 1 or 2 portfolios, each with probably less than a dozen stocks.
StocksMonitor uses JDK 1.4 system Preferences to store all portfolios -
not text files. This is an unusual design. It was selected to make it more
convenient for users to switch portfolios : instead of navigating the file
system, they may simply choose from a simple drop-down list.
